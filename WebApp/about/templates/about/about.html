            <h2>Flom</h2>
            <p>FLOM (Folsom Library Occupancy Monitor) is an open source project made by students in the Rensselaer Community of Open Source class at RPI. Our mission was to provide students with a helpful application that allows them to see which study rooms are available before going to the library. If you have any issues or find any bugs, please raise an issue at this <a href = "https://github.com/FolsomLibraryOccupanyMonitor/FLOM/issues">link</a>.</p>
