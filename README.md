# FLOM
Develop an embedded system that allows students to check what study rooms in the library are occupied and which are not.



FLOM (Folsom Library Occupancy Monitor) is an open source project made by students in the Rensselaer Community of Open 
Source class at RPI. Our mission was to provide students with a helpful application that allows them to see which study 
rooms are available before going to the library.

The base templates for the html pages are in Webapp/templates which is added to the directory path.  To add your own html file 
it starts at the base Webpage folder so navigate from there to where the html is actually stored 
(prefferably in a templates folder within the app).
