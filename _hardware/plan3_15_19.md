##New Hardware Plan

#Remote Raspberry Pi Development

> We're scrapping the remote access plan that was a priority because of issues regarding static IP\
> and port forwarding on home routers. So, because of this, we will be moving on and going to a\
> different development scheme.

#Meeting Plan

> We're going to meet twice a week; once during the week and once during the weekend. We will stay\
> in touch in order to plan our meetings depending on when we have time. Conflicts of time are the\
> the biggest barriers with regard to meeting.

#Priorities

> We are shifting our priorities from getting a working remote development environment working to\
> getting output data directly from the sensors for the software team to analyze and work with.
