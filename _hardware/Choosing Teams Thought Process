Thought Process for Picking Teams on FLOM

Going into this project, I knew the software aspect of this project would be much more rigorous 
than the hardware part would be.  With this in mind, I purposely split up each team putting more 
people on the software side than the hardware.  I knew that the hardware team, once we got the sensors going, 
would run out of things to do that was within scope of this project. I knew that developing the back end and 
front end of a web app and all the software that this project requires, that their team would not run 
out of work to do.  Taking all this into consideration I sent 6 kids to the software development team and 
kept 3 kids, (plus me) to the hardware team.  Some students on the software team were took interest in learning 
more about the hardware but I felt they would be more useful on the software end so they stuck to doing software but 
also joined us some days to see what we were doing and ask questions.
