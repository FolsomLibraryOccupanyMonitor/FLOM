## Steps for setting up for remote access:

> Set up tigervnc on the pi\
> If tigervnc doesn't work, install Remmina; I've used it before but vnc is standard\
> Need to set up remote to allow connections from an outside network\
> If you want to set a static IP, you can. I have no experience doing this but it can help make remoting more solid\
> Find a place where we can set the pi up semi-permanently and turn it on\
> From there find the IP on the pi and send to hardware devs\
> Hardware devs can then remote into the pi and work on programming the sensors
