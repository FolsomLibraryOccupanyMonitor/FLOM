This is the process we used to choose a sensor for this system.
There are many different sensors that could be used for this project, a few that we looked into are listed below.
1. IR: These detectors are little microchips with a photocell that is tuned to listen to infrared light.  
2. PIR (specific type of IR):These are most commonly used to detect motion for home security systems.  When the system is turned on, the motion sensor is activated and warms up.
Once it is ready it can detect heat and movement in the surrounding area.  It creates a protective "grid: and if a moving object blocks too many grid zones,
the infrared energy levels change and the sensors are tripped sending a signal to the receiving end of the system.
3. Ultrasonic: These sensors measure distance by using ultrasonic waves.  The sensor head emits an ultrasonic wave and receieves
the wave reflection back from the target,  They measure the distance to the target by measuring the time between the emission and reception.
4. Pressure: A pressure sensor is an instrument conissting of a pressure sensitive element to determine the actual pressure applied to the sensor and other components to convert the into into an output signal
5. MicroWave:  This device detects motion and can be used to control luminaires.  They project microwaves which bounce off surfaces and return to a sensor within the detector.
6. Vibration: These sensors measure, display and analyze linear velocity, displacement and proximity, or acceleration.

While all these choices potentially could work, we did some research and benchmarking in order to decide which one would work best

The team ended up ordering 3 of the 6 listed sensors to use to test our preliminary system.  (PIR, IR Array, and Ultrasonic.) After testing the 3, we have decided that 
the IR Array sensor is the one we will move forward with.
