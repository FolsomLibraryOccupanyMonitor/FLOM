I used this link to help decide what kind of material to house the sensor in.  The idea for hardware housing is to have the RPi and accompanying wires and such inside an insulted container that is mounted into the ceiling.  The ceiling of the library are square panels that are easily removable so the container would hide in the panels and there would be a tiny cutout for the sensor to drop down from the ceiling so it can see the room.  We will use a thermally transparent material to make a tiny dome to cover the sensor to ensure its security.  There are rough diagrams in the Git that show exactly what it will look like.}
