This is the process we used to choose a sensor for this system.
There are many different sensors that could be used for this project, a few that we looked into are listed below.
1. IR 
2. PIR (specific type of IR)
3. Ultrasonic
4. Pressure 
5. MicroWave
6. Vibration

While all these choices potentially could work, we did some research and benchmarking in order to decide which one would work best

IR:

PIR:These are most commonly used to detect motion for home security systems.  When the system is turned on, the motion sensor is activated and warms up.
Once it is ready it can detect heat and movement in the surrounding area.  It creates a protective "grid: and if a moving object blocks too many grid zones,
the infrared energy levels change and the sensors are tripped sending a signal to the receiving end of the system.

Ultrasonic:
Pressure:
MicroWave:
Vibration:
