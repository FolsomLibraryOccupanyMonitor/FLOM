 IR Sensor Pseudocode for Main()
 
 Initialize Sensor
 Initialize I2C components
 
 //Different cases to consider
 Someone walking in while someone walking out
 Temperature differences at different times of the day(sunlight?)
 Soemone leaving to use the bathroom or etc. 
 While(on)
        Call CreateBaseline() (Need to establish a baseline on testing an empty room)
        Call ReadSensor() //Use I2C Function Calls within this function        
        Compare baseline and reading
         while (not empty) //Comes from comparing baseline and reading
        
                Call ReadSensor()  //Error Checking to make sure someone is actually in the room
                Check for any changes from baseline
                        if yes make sure it is not an error
                        if no continue
                        
                Store output data into container (matrix of vectors?)
                ParseFunction() //Parse Data and organize it for delivery to webserver
                               - Create a function within parse function to send data
